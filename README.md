This project is primarily intended to explore data related to healthcare claims, reveal factors that lead to higher claims, and derive insight into what suggests potential insurance fraud.
Secondly, I hope to build machine learning models that can predict likely fraud cases using Python, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.
